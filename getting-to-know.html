  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Griffin Ebel and I’m currently a sophmore here. I grew up fairly local to the Lewis area being born and raised in New Lenox, which is only about a thirty-minute drive from the campus; it was also rated as one of the most boring suburbs in Illinois which is part of the reason I decided to stay on campus here at Lewis. My family is about average size at five people, giving me two siblings: an older brother and sister. I also have four pets, one of which is a Dog and the remaining three are all cats. I don’t pick favorites with them though because they are all equally as cool in my eyes. On the flip side, I am planning to declare as a UAS major at the end of this semester, but I am also still trying to figure out a minor I would like to add. Anyways, that’s about all my biographical information, unfortunately not that interesting of a guy.  </p>

<h1><Bold>My Favorite Hobby: Cooking</Bold></h1>
<p>While I love my Mom, her lackluster cooking abilities are what inspired me to begin cooking around my freshman year of high school. I immediately fell in love with cooking and it remains at the top of my destressing activities today. I also enjoy experimenting in the kitchen with less common flavors and pairings. As pictured below, my favorite experiment I have done was bacon pancakes as they were the absolute perfect combination of sweet and savory. All in all, cooking is my all-time favorite destressing activities and I have no qualms doing it every day.</p>
